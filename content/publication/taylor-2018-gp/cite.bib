 abstract = {In this study we have explored several aspects of regional
analyte suppression in mass spectrometry imaging of a
heterogeneous sample; transverse cryosections of mouse brain.
Olanzapine was homogeneously coated across the section prior to
DESI and MALDI mass spectrometry imaging. We employed the
concept of a tissue extinction coefficient (TEC) to assess
suppression of an analyte on tissue relative to its intensity in
an off tissue region. We expanded the use of TEC, by first
segmenting anatomical regions using graph-cuts clustering, and
calculating a TEC for each cluster. The single ion image of the
olanzapine [M+H]+ ion was seen to vary considerably across the
image, with anatomical features such as the white matter and
hippocampus visible. While trends in regional ion suppression
were conserved across MSI modalities, significant changes in the
magnitude of relative regional suppression effects between
techniques were seen. Notably the intensity of olanzapine was
less suppressed in DESI than for MALDI. In MALDI MSI,
significant differences in the concentration dependence of
regional TECs were seen, with the TEC of white matter clusters
exhibiting a notably stronger correlation with concentration
than for clusters associated with grey matter regions. We
further employed cluster-specific TECs as regional normalisation
factors. In comparison to published pixel-by-pixel normalisation
methods, regional TEC normalisation exhibited superior reduction
ion suppression artefacts. We also considered the usefulness of
a segmentation-based approach to compare spectral information
obtained from complementary modalities.},
