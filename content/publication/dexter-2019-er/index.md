abstract: "Within drug development and pre-clinical trials, a common, significant and poorly understood event is the development of drug-induced lipidosis in tissues and cells. In this manuscript, we describe a mass spectrometry imaging strategy, involving repeated analysis of tissue sections by DESI MS, in positive and negative polarities, using MS and MS/MS modes. We present results of the detected distributions of the administered drug, drug metabolites, lipid molecules and a putative marker of lipidosis, di-docosahexaenoyl (22:6)-bis(monoacylglycerol) phosphate (di-22:6-BMP). A range of strategies have previously been reported for detection, isolation and identification of this compound, which is an isomer of di-docosahexaenoic (22:6 n-3) phosphatidylglycerol (di-22:6 PG), a commonly found lipid that acts as a surfactant in lung tissues. We show that MS imaging using MS/MS can be used to differentiate these compounds of identical mass, based upon the different distributions of abundant fragment ions. Registration of images of these fragments, and detected drugs and metabolites, is presented as a new method for studying drug-induced lipidosis in tissues. Graphical abstract."
