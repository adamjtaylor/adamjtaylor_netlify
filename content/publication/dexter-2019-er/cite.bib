 abstract = {Within drug development and pre-clinical trials, a common,
significant and poorly understood event is the development of
drug-induced lipidosis in tissues and cells. In this manuscript,
we describe a mass spectrometry imaging strategy, involving
repeated analysis of tissue sections by DESI MS, in positive and
negative polarities, using MS and MS/MS modes. We present
results of the detected distributions of the administered drug,
drug metabolites, lipid molecules and a putative marker of
lipidosis, di-docosahexaenoyl (22:6)-bis(monoacylglycerol)
phosphate (di-22:6-BMP). A range of strategies have previously
been reported for detection, isolation and identification of
this compound, which is an isomer of di-docosahexaenoic (22:6
n-3) phosphatidylglycerol (di-22:6 PG), a commonly found lipid
that acts as a surfactant in lung tissues. We show that MS
imaging using MS/MS can be used to differentiate these compounds
of identical mass, based upon the different distributions of
abundant fragment ions. Registration of images of these
fragments, and detected drugs and metabolites, is presented as a
new method for studying drug-induced lipidosis in tissues.
