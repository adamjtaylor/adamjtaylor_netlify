 abstract = {The extracellular matrix (ECM) of mammalian tissues has been
isolated, decellularized and utilized as a scaffold to
facilitate the repair and reconstruction of numerous tissues.
Recent studies have suggested that superior function and complex
tissue formation occurred when ECM scaffolds were derived from
site-specific homologous tissues compared with heterologous
tissues. The objectives of the present study were to apply a
stringent decellularization process to demineralized bone matrix
(DBM), prepared from bovine bone, and to characterize the
structure and composition of the resulting ECM materials and DBM
itself. Additionally, we sought to produce a soluble form of DBM
and ECM which could be induced to form a hydrogel. Current
clinical delivery of DBM particles for treatment of bone defects
requires incorporation of the particles within a carrier liquid.
Differences in osteogenic activity, inflammation and
nephrotoxicity have been reported with various carrier liquids.
The use of hydrogel forms of DBM or ECM may reduce the need for
carrier liquids. DBM and ECM hydrogels exhibited sigmoidal
gelation kinetics consistent with a nucleation and growth
mechanism, with ECM hydrogels characterized by lower storage
moduli than the DBM hydrogels. Enhanced proliferation of mouse
primary calvarial cells was achieved on ECM hydrogels, compared
with collagen type I and DBM hydrogels. These results show that
DBM and ECM hydrogels have distinct structural, mechanical and
biological properties and have the potential for clinical
delivery without the need for carrier liquids.},
