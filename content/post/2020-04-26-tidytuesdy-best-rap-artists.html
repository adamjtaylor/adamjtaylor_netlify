<p>Another #tidytuesday. This time on the best rap songs per a BBC music poll. Most of the critics were from the USA (n = 73), and I wondered if their favorite songs differed from those of critics from the rest of the world (n = 34).</p>
<p>The data provided only provided the top 5 songs for each critic and the global ranking, so I had to recalculate the rankings based on the critics country of origin.</p>
<p>A segment plot seemed to be the best way to visualise this. I really wanted to use images as the points - a US flag and a globe. However, I failed to get a working solution despite tesing <code>ggflags</code>, <code>ggimage</code> and various emoji packages - perhaps something to return to.</p>
